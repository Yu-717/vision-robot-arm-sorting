"""Keep-out checks for the gripper: the arm's own platform and the table.

Platform (refitted 2026-09-25): a box around the servo-1 axis, radius `platform_radius_m` (the
operator measured 8 cm from the turntable centre to the platform edge; the map, laid against that
edge, registers at y = 7.5-7.7 cm) and top `platform_min_z_m` (the 9 cm chassis over the table at
-1.42 cm gives +7.6 cm). The gripper is modelled as the gripper-servo housing, +-3.5 cm across over
the first 4 cm below the servo-5 axis (and 2 cm behind it), then the fingers, +-1.5 cm, down to the
tip. A hull point's margin is max(r - R, z - top) (its distance out of the box), and the platform
term must stay above `platform_margin_m`.

These housing sizes are fitted, in forward-kinematics coordinates, between every platform contact
recorded so far -- the hand-placed "servo edge on the frame" [93.4,95,-2,14.6] and the return
[76,86,7,7] -> [90,105,5,5] (2026-09-24), the console contact [103,72,19,3] (2026-09-25 00:50) and
the folded "servo resting on the platform" [90,102,-5,-1] (2026-09-25 19:00) -- which all come to
<= +0.1 cm, and every logged move that ran without contact (>= +0.6 cm; the near-strip refine views
[71,94,5,5] are the closest). The earlier cylinder (10.5 cm, above +4 cm, one +-2.5 cm band) put the
folded contact 3.7 cm inside and blocked the near-field views that ran safely.

The table term keeps that +-2.5 cm band (`hull_half_width_m`): `table_z_m` was fitted with it.
Joint-space moves are checked on interpolated samples, because a path can dip even when both ends
are clear.
